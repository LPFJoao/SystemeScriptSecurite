# Secure Web Stack Installer (Nginx + PHP + MariaDB + HTTPS)

This repository provides a modular and secure Bash-based installer for setting up a complete web development environment using:

- Nginx (with HTTPS and redirect)
- PHP-FPM + common extensions
- MariaDB with a dev user
- phpMyAdmin (auto-integrated into Nginx)
- Node.js and npm
- Git

The setup uses **self-signed SSL certificates** for HTTPS and separates all components into individual scripts for easier maintenance and updates.

## How to test the setup locally

1. Open your browser and go to:
   - https://localhost/phpmyadmin

2. If you get a **certificate warning**, accept it to proceed (it's expected with self-signed certs).

3. Log into phpMyAdmin using:
   - User: `dev`
   - Pass: `devpass`
