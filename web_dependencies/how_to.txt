## 🔧 What it does

- Updates the system
- Installs **Nginx** as the web server
- Installs **PHP-FPM** and necessary PHP extensions
- Installs **MariaDB** and applies basic security configuration
- Installs **phpMyAdmin** without Apache or Lighttpd
- Automatically configures Nginx to serve phpMyAdmin
- Creates a ready-to-use `/var/www/webapp` directory
- Sets up a default `index.php` file with `phpinfo()`
- Installs **Node.js** and **npm**
- Installs **Git**
- Creates a MariaDB user:
  - Username: `dev`
  - Password: `devpass`
  - Grants full access to all databases

## 📂 Directory structure

- `/var/www/webapp` → Main web directory served by Nginx
- `index.php` → Contains a `phpinfo()` test page
- phpMyAdmin accessible via `/phpmyadmin`

## 🔐 MariaDB Access

After installation, you can log in to phpMyAdmin using:

- **Username**: `dev`
- **Password**: `devpass`

> Note: The root MySQL user uses Unix socket authentication by default and cannot log in via phpMyAdmin.
